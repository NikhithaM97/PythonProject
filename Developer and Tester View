**Tester and Developer Views**

The end-requirement user's is "No special character is allowed in Input field."
Developer's role: Clearly, create code for adding an Input field while ensuring that if a user inputs any special character, an error is raised or an appropriate error message is displayed.
Tester's point of view: The tester will initially examine the specified criteria, but he will also consider different situations. He'll wonder things like, "What if only special characters are allowed in the input box?" Will it show the user the same or a different message?
What happens if the user copies and pastes any combination of special and alphanumeric characters into the input box?
